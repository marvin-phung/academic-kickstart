I am sure that the course was supposed to end on a different note, and that all of these readings were planned to lead-up to the HeritageJam, but other worldly circumstances shifted the course dramatically. I'm sitting here reflecting on these last two readings by Kelly and Seneler, and for the last time, here's my take on the readings based on my own experience.

When I reflect on the reading by Seneler on learning styles and cultural backgrounds, I can only agree that museum folk and any sort of public-serving institutions will need to continue to adapt to a changing environment. In this course, we have discussed a lot about the changing physical to digital world, but we have not yet discussed another aspect: changing cultures in society. "[Over one-fifth (21.9%) of Canada's population was foreign born in 2016, up from 19.8% in the 2006 Census and 20.6% in the 2011 National Household Survey (NHS). Statistics Canada projects this could reach between 24.5% and 30.0% by 2036.](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/corporate/publications/evaluations/multiculturalism-program.html)"
