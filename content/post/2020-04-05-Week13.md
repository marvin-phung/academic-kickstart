I am sure that the course was supposed to end on a different note, and that all of these readings were planned to lead-up to the HeritageJam, but other worldly circumstances shifted the course dramatically. I'm sitting here reflecting on these last two readings by Kelly and Seneler, and for the last time, here's my take on the readings based on my own experience.

When I reflect on the reading by Seneler on learning styles and cultural backgrounds, I can only agree that museum folk and any sort of public-serving institutions will need to continue to adapt to a changing environment. In this course, we have discussed a lot about the changing physical to digital world, but we have not yet discussed another aspect: changing cultures in society. Fun fact: "[Over one-fifth (21.9%) of Canada's population was foreign born in 2016, up from 19.8% in the 2006 Census and 20.6% in the 2011 National Household Survey (NHS). Statistics Canada projects this could reach between 24.5% and 30.0% by 2036 ... In 2016, Canada was home to 250 ethnic origins. European countries accounted for 75% of all Canadian immigrants in 1966, 16% in 2010 and 11.6% in 2016. In 2016, Asian countries accounted for 7 of the top 10 countries of birth of recent immigrants in 2016. 13.4% of recent immigrants were born in Africa.](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/corporate/publications/evaluations/multiculturalism-program.html)" That is to say, Canada's demographics continue to shift, primarily because it relies so heavily on immigration (and most Canadians are accepting of immigrants due to their economic benefits). 

Currently, from the federal government side (as well as most provincial and some municipal ones), services are mandated to be offered in English and French (the two Official Languages under the Official Languages Act), but some government bodies, and a lot of non-government bodies have begun to offer services in other common languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, and many more. It becomes more interesting when these services are adapted to fit the nuances of particular cultures. It is not an easy thing and requires significant commitment - both time and resources, but certainly, it is necessary. There is a wider conversation that is possible on the idea of diversity and multiculturalism versus integration and assimilation, and the direction governments take things shifts depending on who is in power. Regardless, it is undeniable that Canada's demographics will continue to shift drastically in only a couple of decades, and it will be the responsibility of the private and public sector to adapt, and cater to its new consumer base, it is only a matter of how they do it.

Now, onto the second article on the post-digital visitor, I will merely say that I agree the way that people learn continues to shift, and we do not really know where it will settle or slow down. The motivating factors for this shift have to do with new technologies and their widespread accessibility (i.e. based on price and regional availability), but also based on innovators (first out of the gate) who set the stage. There is certainly significant room for change.
