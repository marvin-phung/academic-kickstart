title: Devlog 11 - Budgeting and Bookkeeping
---
This devlog is focused entirely on the presentation that I made for the March 30th seminar, 4.1. Budgeting and Bookkeeping. The presentation is exceedingly long, so I included a summary of the two readings at the end of each section.

Discussion questions:
1. Do you think museums should be a “core federal responsibility” (essential to society)? How do you define essential?
2. Do you think that museums are important politically, economically, socially, overall?
3. What are other reasons that attendance increases when funding falls? Do you accept Skinner, Elekund, and Jackson’s explanation (less employment ->  less emphasis on time -> more museum visits)?
4. Based on what we have seen in the class, are Canadian museums underfunded the same way that American museums are?
5. Morally, at what point do you think a national museum deviates from its original purpose (it’s “mission”) through commercialization activities (exhibitions, retail, merchandise, admissions, etc.), if ever? Do you accept Toepler’s explanation of preferred and non-preferred goods?
6. In the context of the current COVID-19 crisis, what amount is right to invest into sustaining museums (and the arts more generally)? Should we be focusing on the present or planning for the future?
